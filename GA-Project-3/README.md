## Project Overview

---

An app to track your travels and share with the travel community with a members dashboard featuring a map with each location visisted, a status bar to track how many countries travelled to so far, and a subsection with each trip a user has been on with their comments of how the trip went.

This was a collaborative three person project with a 14 day timeframe to complete and present our work.
