## Project Overview

---

An app to track your travels and share with the travel community your experiences with a members dashboard featuring a map with a drop pin of each location visisted, a status bar to track how many countries travelled to so far, and a subsection with each trip a user has been on with their comments of how the trip went.

This was a collaborative three person project with a 14 day timeframe to complete and present our work.

### Day 1-3:

We decided the first week should be dedicated to project planning and fleshing out the backend, while the second week focused on creating the frontend. Initially we brainstormed ideas, settling on creating a travel app early on and then further brainstorming features our project should have. We then used Figma to create a basic design displaying each page we would create and their subcomponents.

We then set up a trello kanban board to enable agile working with a backlog of tasks ranked and assigned to each member of the team, most of which were group tasks to begin with, so we could hone in on the models we would need based on the project requirements, and have a base backend from which we could then work on separately.

For the sake of simplicity and an expeditious initial coding experience, we group coded using VS Code Live Share and Zoom to create the base backend database using Express and MongoDB. We took turns to code different aspects of the same element of our backend before moving on to work individually. This ensured a smooth coding experience and also allowed us to allocate days to our timelime for problem solving.

After settling on our models for the project, we then assigned different responsbilities on our kanban board that would not conflict with each other while using VS Code Live Share to develop different aspects of the backend at the same time to ensure functionality at this early stage. We took one model each, then focused on creating the relevant controllers for each model, shared our work with the group, created the seed data together and tested it successfully.

Below is our Trello kanban board post project completion.

### Day 4-7:

From here as a team we were able to develop the different aspects of the backend we were individually responsible for at a similar pace helping each other as we went, pushing and merging code when we hit significant milestones. This meant we spent a suitable amount of time checking each others work for quality assurance and to allocate time for testing.

We applied further middleware to ensure functionality such as CORS and environment variables using DotEnv and proceeded to create our endpoints, authorisation, and secure routes. My focus, after adding some key endpoints, was to create a secure route using JSON Web Token and DotEnv to enable registration & login on the frontend and endpoints that require a bearer token to access.

```Javascript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'
import User from '../models/user.js'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config();

//make sure that the user making the request has a valid token
async function secureRoute(req, res, next) {
  try {
    //get the token from the headers
    const authToken = req.headers.authorization;

    //if there is no token or the string doesnt start with Bearer, return anathorised
    if (!authToken || !authToken.startsWith("Bearer")) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .send({ message: "Not authorized to perform this funciton" });
    }

    //strip the Bearer part of the token out as it doesnt hold any data

    const token = authToken.replace("Bearer ", "");

    console.log("ðŸ¤– AUTHTOKEN" + " " + authToken);
    console.log("ðŸ¤– STRIPPED TOKEN" + " " + token);

    //try to extract the data on the token using the secret. Also handles errors


    jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET, async (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(401).send({ message: "Unauthorized" });
      }

      console.log("RESPONSE FROM JWT IS >>> ", data);

      //find the user by id using the id on the token (set in the user controller)

      const user = await User.findById(data.userId);

      if (!user) {
        return res.status(404).send({ message: "User not found" });
      }

      //object level permissions - we will come back to this later
      req.currentUser = user;

      next();
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return res.status(401).send({ message: "Unauthorized user!!" });
  }
}

export default secureRoute;
```

I set up a postman workspace so if any member of the team wished to test any functionality locally they would be able to. However, we mostly used zoom and postman on my machine for time efficiency. We tested our endpoints with and without a bearer token for those that were and were not locked down by our secure route.

### Day 8-9:

Similar to our initial approach creating our backend, we coded as a group and initialized our React frontend locally on my machine, using Zoom and VS Code Live Share to edit the same project file. This ensured a functional base frontend we could push to Git Hub before we worked on componenets individually. We created a simple layout, functionality to call our backend using Axios, and the basics of responsive search on our coutries page. From here my focus was on the members dashboard while my team created other aspects of the app, such as CountriesCard component and responsive search.

### Day 10-14:

I created the members dashboard settling on using React Map GL due to users being able to have 10,000 API calls per month for free compared to Google, which past a certain amount of API calls will charge for usage. Despite this I would end up having to use the Google API regardless. I created a basic form to create trips and post data to our database. However this highlighted one issue with our models which was comments. This meant we had to revisit our backend and tweak our models to enable comments to be posted correctly. This was partly due to the fact we have a many-to-many relationship between the models in our database.

This was challenging as we were unsure why we were facing this issue. Although I spent some time identifying the problem using postman and revisiting the backend with my team, once we understood why we were unable to post comments my focus returned to the members dashboard. I was able to use the CountriesCard component my team had made and map all the countries a user had visisted over the component creating members cards giving details of their trip. 

Then I hardcoded data into the map component to display drop pins to demonstrate that conceptually the map component is operating successfully. The next challenge was turning the user data from the database into latitude and longditude coordinates that the map component would then be able to display.

Ultimately I used Google Geocode API which allows one to send a string of a location and receive back a multitude of data, some of which were the latitude and longditude for that location. Once that data was sent back from Google Geocode I simply set it into some state and passed it down through props which mapped it over the map subcomponent on the dashboard page.

I also wanted to make the Country Cards of each location a user had visted more interesting, so I searched for image APIs which served an image if a user submitted a location. I used Pexals Image API as it was free and seemed to produce the most accurate images based on the string, however it is not perfect and sometimes provides a seemling unrelated image. Here I found two more bugs. When a user first logs in, all the drop pins on the map will not render unless the map is moved by the user. Secondly environment variables were not working when using DotEnv and, as we were still trying to fix the backend comments issue, we decided to hardcode the API keys and clean up the code once we were able to.

Lastly I created a progress bar of countries visisted while my team worked on styling the rest of the website, finishing responsive search and creating the login and register pages which I styled to match the members dashboard.

## Featured Code

---

As I was responsible for the members dashboard, below are some key excerpts I am proud of that allow our API to be functional with the external API's I chose to use.

Firstly we get all the country data and set it to some state with `setCountries`.

```Javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    getAllCountries().then(function (response) {
      setCountries(response.data)
    })
  }, [])
```

Next we filter all the country data by the current user that is logged in. A `useEffect` finds the `userId` based on the bearer token in local storage and passes into the `getUser` function. Although during this stage of development we could have created an endpoint to get all countries by `userId`, I did not want to add extra work for my team at the time as they were already problem solving an issue on the backend and our project time was almost over, so I used this method as a work around.

```Javascript
 useEffect(() => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token')
    getUser(token).then((response) => setUserId(response))
  }, [])
```

As the getAllCountries function gets all data related to where a user has visited not just the country names we need to filter this down to just country names matching the current user and set it to some state `setUserCountries`. However as our database at the time recorded the username of our users when they posted data and not the userId I had to match `userId.data.username`. We've changed this in our backend so now userId is displayed also however this is not reflected in our frontend yet. For better semantic sense `setUserCountries` could be `setCountryNames`.

As we will also use this data to map over our MembersCard.js component and I didn't want to filter the data again later I set this newly filtered data to it's own state to use later `setCountryData`. For better semantic sense this could be `setFilteredCountryData`.

```Javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (!userId || !countries) {
      return
    } else {
      const username = userId.data.username
      const countryKey = countries.filter((country) => country.createdBy)
      let mappedKey = countryKey.map((item) => ({
        name: item.name,
        createdBy: item.createdBy.username,
      }))
      let finalCountries = mappedKey.filter(
        (country) => country.createdBy == username
      )
      setUserCountries(finalCountries)

            let countryDataParsed = countryKey
        .map((item) => ({
          name: item.name,
          city: item.city,
          yearVisited: item.yearVisited,
          comments: item.comments,
          rating: item.rating,
          createdBy: item.createdBy.username,
        }))
        .filter((country) => country.createdBy == username)
      setCountryData(countryDataParsed)
      // console.log(`COUNTRYDATAAA >>>> `, countryDataParsed)
    }
  }, [userId, countries])

```

Next we have our Geocode function `getCoordinates` which allows you to pass in a string of location, recieve a latitude and longditude, push the coordinates into an array variable `geocodedCountries` and set that to some state using `setCoordinates`. We have a use effect that calls this function when it's dependcy array `userCountries` changes, which we set in the previous block of code.

```Javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!userCountries) {
      return
    }
    const array = userCountries
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      getCoordinates(array[i].name)
    }
    // console.log(`number of user countries are`, array.length)
  }, [userCountries])

const getCoordinates = async (location) => {
    Geocode.fromAddress(location).then(
      (response) => {
        geocodedCountries.push(response.results[0].geometry.location)
        console.log(`Data from function`, geocodedCountries)
        setCoordinates(geocodedCountries)
      },
      (error) => {
        console.error(error)
      }
    )
  }
```

Now we have our coordinates in some state called `coordinates` we can easily pass this down via props to a our map component and handle that data to create drop pins on the map component to ensure the this file is as short and readable as possible.

```Javascript
<Map props={coordinates} />
```

## Bugs

---

A bug we faced was when a user logs in upon first render of the page one or none of the drop pins on the map will display despite the user having visisted many countries until the user interacts with the map.

## Wins and Challenges

---

Using maps, problem solving how to turn data from our database into map coordinates and images on the country cards was very enjoyable and just working with a map componenet in general was very exciting. It was certainly a stretch and extremely challenging especially as time was encroaching.

One of the challenges was how we set up our backend initially with regards to models. We had to make a slight modification to be able to populate user data and also allow comments for each trip. This meant some of our data that we added to our database had missing aspects and that our initial seed database function was no longer operational as the models had changed. Starting with a fresh database this isn't a problem but if one wanted to retain the existing data this would be an issue however a simple work around would be to add on the front end either optional chaining so missing data does not get rendered yet the allow the page to render or alternatively simply state the user has not entered this data yet and allow edit functionality.

## Key Learnings

---

It's extremely important to have a very clear idea of what precisely will be the funcitonality of the app so you can clearly define models from the outset so they don't need to be modified later during development, however I would assume as apps become more successful or needs of the end user change models will need to be updated to accomodate future features.

That the most obvious way to solve a problem might not be the best based on the timeframe and other members of your team working on the same part of a project e.g. both working on the backend one solving a bug and another adding a feature. Adding a feature may exaserbate the bug and create more issues. So perhaps there is another way to solve the problem which can be revisted once the bug is fixed but will still maintain the end user experience. How to manipulate, filter, map data to make it usable.

Structuring the way one works with others is crucial to ensure efficient use of time. This means the obvious such as using agile working, strong initial planning, and assigning jobs to people based on interest and capacity or desire to work on a task. However, this also extends to how day to day coding works too such as scheduling time in a group as we all were working full time and also had responsibilities outside of the immersive that were time demanding but also small things such as having one person also run a working base version of the code from which everyone can live code and contribute to initially and pushing the groups work to git hub, until individuals are able to work on aspects that when merged wont intefere with the functionality of the existing code base.

## Future Content and Improvements

---

The majority of my focus on was functionality as I believed it would potentially be extremely challenging to achieve the functionality I had planned for in the members dashboard given our time requirements especially as we had to revisit our backend to solve a problem during our second week which was meant to be completely dedicated to our front end. More time can be spent improving styling overall on the website. As well as this edit functionality in the members area can be added.
